PyBOP is equipped with a series of robust tools that can help you optimise various parameters within your battery models to better match empirical data or to explore the effects of different parameters on battery behavior.

To begin using PyBOP:

1. Install the package using pip:

   .. code-block:: console

       pip install pybop

   For detailed installation instructions, including how to install specific versions or from source, see the :ref:`installation` section.

2. Once PyBOP is installed, you can import it in your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks:

   .. code-block:: python

       import pybop

   Now you're ready to utilise PyBOP's functionality in your projects!

Exploring Examples
------------------

To help you get acquainted with PyBOP's capabilities, we provide a collection of examples that demonstrate common use cases and features of the package:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks that include detailed explanations alongside the live code, visualisations, and results. These are an excellent resource for learning and can be easily modified and executed to suit your needs.

- **Python Scripts**: For those who prefer working in a text editor, IDE, or for integrating into larger projects, we provide equivalent examples in plain Python script format.

You can find these resources in the ``examples`` folder of the PyBOP repository. To access the examples, navigate to the following path after cloning or downloading the repository:

.. code-block:: console

    path/to/pybop/examples

These examples are also available on our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/pybop-team/PyBOP/tree/develop/examples>`_.
