# Release Workflow

This document outlines the release workflow for publishing to PyPI and TestPyPI using GitHub Actions.

## Creating a New Release

To create a new release, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Release:**
   -  Create a new branch for the release (i.e. `v24.XX`) from `develop`.
   -  Increment the following;
         -  The version number in the `pyproject.toml` file following CalVer versioning.
         -  The`CHANGELOG.md` version with the changes for the new version.
   -  Open a PR to the `main` branch. Once the PR is merged, proceed to the next step.

2. **Tag the Release:**
   -  Create a new Git tag for the release. For a full release, use a tag like `v24.2`. For a release candidate, use a tag like `v24.2rc.1`.
   -  Push the tag to the remote repository: `git push origin <tag_name>`.

3. **Create a GitHub Release:**
   -  Go to the "Releases" section of on GitHub.
   -  Click "Draft a new release."
   -  Enter the tag you created in the "Tag version" field.
   -  Fill in the release title and description. Add any major changes and link to the `CHANGELOG.md` for a list of total changes.
   -  If it's a pre-release (release candidate), check the "This is a pre-release" checkbox.
   -  Click "Publish release" to create the release.

4. **Monitor the Workflow:**
   -  Go to the "Actions" tab of your repository to monitor the workflow's progress.
   -  The workflow will build the distribution packages and then publish them to PyPI or TestPyPI, depending on whether the release is a full release or a pre-release.

5. **Verify the Release:**
   -  Check PyPI or TestPyPI to ensure that your package is available and has been updated to the new version.
   -  Test installing the package using `pip` to ensure everything works as expected.
