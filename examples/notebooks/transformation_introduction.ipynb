    "# Introduction to Transformations\n",
    "This example introduces the `pybop.BaseTransformation` class and it's instances. This class adds functionality for the cost and likelihood functions to be transformed into a separate search space. This search space is used by the optimiser and sampler classes during inference. These transformations can be both linear (`pybop.ScaledTransformation`) and non-linear (`pybop.LogTransformation`). By default, if transformations are applied, the sampling and optimisers will search in the transformed space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformation can be helpful when the difference in parameter magnitudes is large, or to create a search space that is better posed for the optimisation algorithm. Before we begin, we need to ensure that we have all the necessary tools. We will install and import PyBOP alongside any other package dependencies."
